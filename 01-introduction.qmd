# Introduction

This guide provides instructions for implementing a code peer review system using GitHub for undergraduate computing modules. With the new automation scripts, most of the setup process is now automated, making implementation much faster and more reliable. The system integrates with Moodle for familiar student submission and leverages GitHub's collaborative features for peer review.

## What is Code Peer Review? Why on Github?

Code peer review is when you look at another student's code and give them helpful feedback, just like when you review each other's essays. At the same time, other students will review your code and give you feedback. This helps everyone learn from each other and improve their coding skills. Learning to review code and use GitHub will help you in your career because:

- Most tech companies use GitHub or similar tools
- Code review is a standard practice in professional programming
- It teaches you to read and understand other people's code
- It helps you write clearer, better code
- It's a valuable skill to mention in job applications

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a website that programmers use to share and work on code together. Think of it like Google Docs, but specifically designed for computer code. Don't worry if you've never used it before - this guide will walk you through everything step by step!
