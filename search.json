With the new automation scripts, most of the setup process is now automated, making implementation much faster and more reliable. The system integrates with Moodle for familiar student submission and leverages GitHub’s collaborative features for peer review.\nCode peer review is when you look at another student’s code and give them helpful feedback, just like when you review each other’s essays. At the same time, other students will review your code and give you feedback. This helps everyone learn from each other and improve their coding skills. Learning to review code and use GitHub will help you in your career because:",

Prepare Your Data\nCreate your student list (student_list.csv):\nstudent_id,github_username,ucl_email,name\n12345,alice_github,alice.smith@ucl.ac.uk,Alice Smith\n12346,bob_jones,bob.jones@ucl.ac.uk,Bob Jones\n12347,carol_white,carol.white@ucl.ac.uk,Carol White\nOrganize student submissions: Download submissions from Moodle and organize them in folders:\nsubmissions/\n├── 12345/\n│   ├── analysis.R\n│   └── data_cleaning.R\n├── 12346/\n│   ├── analysis.R\n│   └── visualization.R\n\n\n3.1.3 3. Run the Automation\nConfigure the main script: Edit these variables in main_automation_script.R:\nORG_NAME &lt;- \"UCL-StatSci-STAT0001-2025\"      # Your GitHub organization\nASSIGNMENT_NAME &lt;- \"assignment-1\"            # Current assignment\nLOCAL_SUBMISSIONS_PATH &lt;- \"submissions/\"     # Path to submissions\nExecute the automation:\nsource(\"main_automation_script.R\")\nWhat happens automatically: - ✅ Creates private repositories for each student - ✅ Sets up reviewer branches and issue templates - ✅ Uploads all student files - ✅ Randomly assigns peer reviewers (2 per student) - ✅ Sets repository permissions - ✅ Generates email templates and distribution URLs\n\n\n3.1.4 4. Distribute Access Information\nThe script generates several files: - student_repo_links.csv - Repository URLs for each student - email_templates/ - Personalized emails for each student - reviewer_assignments.csv - Complete assignment matrix\nSend emails to students: Use the generated email templates or import the CSV data into your email system for mail merge.\n\n\n3.1.5 5. Monitor Progress\nTrack completion in real-time:\nsource(\"monitor_progress.R\")\nreport &lt;- run_progress_check()\nWhat you get: - Completion rates across all students - Visual progress charts - Detailed analytics - Automated reminder emails for incomplete reviews\nThe section below is a very detailed explanation of the workflow.

Choose organization name: UCL-[Department]-[Module]-[Year] 4. Set to “Private” initially 5. Add description and contact information\nThe automation handles all repository creation and configuration.\n\n\n4.1.2 Assessment Preparation\nBefore running automation, prepare:\nIssue Templates (automatically created): The scripts create structured peer review templates with sections for: - Code quality assessment - Correctness evaluation - Constructive feedback - Learning reflections\nMarking Criteria Integration: Customize the issue template in github_functions.R to align with your specific marking criteria:\n# Edit the peer_review_template variable to match your assessment goals\nAssignment Instructions: Prepare clear instructions that reference: - Learning objectives for peer review - Timeline and deadlines - Technical support resources - Assessment weighting (if applicable)\n\n\n4.1.3 Student Data Collection\nCollect GitHub usernames efficiently:\nOption 1: Moodle Survey Create a Moodle survey with: - “GitHub username” text field - Instructions for creating GitHub accounts - Link to GitHub Education benefits\nOption 2: Submission Requirement Include GitHub username as part of the assignment submission requirements.\nOption 3: Lab Session Collection Collect usernames during the first computer lab session.\n\n\n4.1.4 File Transfer Workflow\nAutomated Process (Recommended):\n# Place files in submissions/[student_id]/ folders\n# Run the main automation script\nsource(\"main_automation_script.R\")\nManual Process (Backup Method): If automation fails, you can still upload files manually: 1. Create repositories individually 2. Upload files through GitHub web interface 3. Set permissions manually 4. Generate assignment lists manually\n\n\n4.1.5 Managing the Review Process\nMonitoring Student Engagement:\n# Run daily or weekly progress checks\nsource(\"monitor_progress.R\")\nrun_progress_check()\n\n# Generates:\n# - Completion rate summaries\n# - Individual student progress\n# - Reminder emails for laggards\nFacilitating Quality Reviews: - Monitor issue creation across repositories - Look for generic or unconstructive feedback - Highlight examples of excellent reviews to the class - Provide additional guidance if review quality is poor\n\n\n4.1.6 Assessment Integration\nAssessing Peer Review Participation:\nQuantitative Measures: - Completion of required review templates - Timeliness of feedback submission - Engagement with issue discussions\nQualitative Assessment:\n# Use monitoring script to extract review content\n# Assess based on:\n# - Constructiveness of feedback\n# - Specificity of observations\n# - Helpful suggestions provided\n# - Professional communication tone\n\n\n4.1.7 Troubleshooting with Automation\nCommon Issues and Solutions:\nScript Failures:\n# Check configuration\nsource(\"setup_config.R\")\nvalidate_configuration()\n\n# Test GitHub connection\ntest_github_connection()\nStudent Access Problems: - Verify GitHub usernames in student_list.csv - Check repository permissions in GitHub organization - Use monitoring script to identify access issues\nFile Upload Issues: - Check file sizes (GitHub limit: 100MB per file) - Verify file paths in submissions folders - Review console output for specific error messages\nIncomplete Reviews:\n# Generate targeted reminders\nsource(\"monitor_progress.R\")\nrun_progress_check()  # Creates reminder emails automatically\n\n\n4.1.8 Advanced Features\nCustomizing Review Assignments: Edit file_management.R to modify reviewer assignment logic:\n# Change number of reviewers per student\nassign_peer_reviewers(students, reviews_per_student = 3)\n\n# Implement stratified assignment (e.g., by ability level)\n# Custom logic can be added to the assign_peer_reviewers function\nIntegration with Continuous Assessment: - Use repository activity for participation grades - Track improvement over multiple assignments - Monitor collaborative discussion quality\nScaling for Large Classes: The automation scripts handle classes up to 200+ students efficiently: - Batch processing minimizes API rate limits - Progress monitoring scales automatically - Email generation handles large volumes\n\n\n4.1.9 Alternative Workflows\nFor Smaller Classes (&lt;20 students): Consider having all students review all submissions for maximum learning.\nFor Advanced Students: - Enable pull request reviews in addition to issues - Encourage code improvement suggestions - Allow collaborative debugging sessions\nFor Assessment-Heavy Modules: - Use multiple rounds of peer review - Implement peer review of peer reviews (meta-review) - Create portfolio-based assessment incorporating peer feedback",

Click the link your teacher sends you to access the code 2. Look for a button or link that says “Issues” 3. Click “New Issue” 4. You’ll see a template with questions - just fill in your answers 5. Click “Submit new issue” when you’re done\n\n\n5.1.2.2 Part 2: Suggest Code Changes (Optional)\nIf you spot a bug or have an idea for improvement, you can suggest specific changes to the code.\nHow to do this: 1. Find the code file you want to change 2. Click the pencil icon (edit button) 3. Make your suggested changes 4. At the bottom, write a message explaining what you changed and why 5. Click “Propose changes” 6. Click “Create pull request” 7. Add a description of your suggestion and click “Create pull request”",

GitHub can seem overwhelming at first\nAsk your teacher or classmates for help\nMost buttons are safe to click - you won’t break anything\nRemember that everyone is learning\n\n\n\n5.3.4 Making the Most of Feedback\n\nDon’t take criticism personally - it’s about the code, not you\nTry to understand why reviewers made their suggestions\nFeel free to ask follow-up questions\nUse the feedback to improve your next assignment",
