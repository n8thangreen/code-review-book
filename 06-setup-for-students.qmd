# Set-up for Students

### Step 1: Create Your GitHub Account

If you already have a GitHub account under another email address and want to use it for the code review, then please go to the next section. Otherwise:

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)  
2. Click "Sign up"  
3. Choose a username (tip: itâ€™s recommended to use something professional, as you might later use this account for job applications!)  
4. Use your UCL email address  
5. Create a strong password  
6. Verify your email when GitHub sends you a message  

### Step 2: Upload Your Assignment to Moodle

- Submit your code assignment to Moodle as you normally would  
- Also include **your GitHub username** in your submission, unless your teacher has other specific requests (in that case, follow their instructions).
